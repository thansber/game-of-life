Game of Life Companion
======================
My daughter has recently taken an interest in the board game Life and she
is too young to handle banker duties herself so it always falls to me to 
fulfill those duties.  I find it a pain and looked to see if there was
an updated version either using an iPad or some other form of technology
to automate the banking duties but I did not find anything.  

This application alleviates those banking duties and handles all cash 
transactions automatically.  You still play the game like normal, spinning
the wheel and moving your little cars, but anytime you need to handle
money, use this application rather than dealing with the paper money that comes
with the game.

Enjoy.
